Since its emergence in the beginning of the twenty-first century as an
after-effect of the collapse of the dotcom, Web 2.0 has increasingly
deepened the networking of platforms and users, generating an
increase in interactivity, participation and engagement [@oreilly_what_2005]. These new platforms, such as social media, apps and Google, for
example, create and strengthen relational networks between humans by
fostering affective archives [@pybus_accumulating_2015], make the world coherent and
intelligible through visual and conceptual mapping [@gordon_mapping_2007], and, more importantly for this article, redefine subject-object
relations through adaptable algorithms [@uricchio_algorithmic_2011].

The adaptable platforms and algorithms of Web 2.0 have "a
transformative effect on how we expect to receive and share information"
[@pybus_accumulating_2015, 235], but also redistribute our subjectivity in the
semiotic regime of web ubiquity in an era where constant connection is
the norm. Targeted advertising and social media are two examples of
the constant redefinition and redistribution of subjects by
attempts at fixating them in space and in time. Surfing the web has become engulfed by processes of power that take the form of suggested content and codify opinions, consumption and habits. This regime of digital semiotization,
driven quasi-exclusively by Google's AdSense and Facebook's adaptable
interface, has generated both concern and interest from researchers in a
variety of disciplines: legal studies, social sciences, psychology,
design, mathematics, economics, politics, etc.

Several scholars of political economy have studied how targeted and
adaptive content is framed through capitalist principles [@fuchs_contribution_2011;
@zuckerman_internets_2014], namely political and hierarchized distributions of
users and the monetization of specific sources of content and products. What content is 
distributed belongs to the few who can afford to purchase visibility and the monopoly of consumer attention. 
Redistribution of the semiotics of consumption towards the
evanescence of the web also alters the habits, physicality and
temporality of consumption as it becomes removed from the sphere of
corporeality [@kessous_les_2012]. Capital thus circulates in ethereal environments according to a hierarchized, capital-based economy. Considering that 88.7% of Google's
multi-billion yearly profit comes from advertising [@graham_google_2017], the
prevalence of a hierarchized, ad-based model over any other free-market collectivism 
fosters some profound political economy problematics such as the enframing of
visibility and opportunity within the bounds of capital in the
seemingly open environment of the Internet.

In stride with these problematics, legal scholars and law-makers are
concerned about the security (or lack thereof) of users, as well as the
lawless usage and tracking of freely circulating personal data for
profit. In the context of companies evading laws regarding data usage
and tracking, issues of privacy [@mcstay_empathic_2016], disempowerment [@heyman_blending_2013; @he_networked_2017] and security [@schneier_surveillance_2013] become
prevalent in questioning the ethics of web usage and increasing the range of national and international legislation.

However relevant and important, the political economy and legal
approaches study the effects and dangers of data use, but not 
the affects of these processes on the users and how they respond to
adaptive platforms. The field of affect theory fills the gap in that
regard, by focusing on emotions and perceptions in the context of social
networking [@boyd_social_2010; @pybus_accumulating_2015], as well as using affect as a means
of proposing new relational territories [@wojtaszek_quest_2014]. One advantage
of this approach is its focus on individual and collective affect and
relational networks, making humans the epicenter of analysis through the
introduction of experience, in all its manifestations and influences,
into the study of processual becomings.

Jennifer Pybus, in her article _Accumulating Affect: Social Networks and
Their Archives of Feelings_, argues that affect is produced by a
networking of something generated inside a body that moves outward and
something outside a body that moves inward [-@pybus_accumulating_2015] 240;
_quoting_ [@ahmed_cultural_2004]. In other words, internal human processes (emotions, desires, moods) are externalized, and external processes (social constructs, culture production, peer pressure) are internalized. As such, the productive tension
between the inside and the outside molds and creates affective
response. She adds a layer of complexity to her conceptualization by
introducing Brian Massumi's concept of vitality affect:

> [...] instead of looking specifically at how affect accumulates
within objects and bodies, he is interested in how shared experiences
between 'forms of life' produce 'vitality affect'- that which gives form
to the parts of our lives that are fundamentally shared through the
rhizomatic movement of affect. [...] The active notion of vitality
encompasses the very complex dynamics that are experienced when subjects
engage with other subjects and/or objects. [...] Objects within the
archive equally weave a complex web of interconnectivity; hence for
Massumi, there is a deep resonance imbricated within the relational
traces that these always embody. [@pybus_accumulating_2015, 241]

Following Pybus' theorization of affect in relation to social media,
what is made apparent is both the permeability of human subjectivities
to interior and exterior influence and the constant redistribution of
these subjectivities by networking with subjects and objects. What is
more, affect archives a cumulative web of interconnexion in engaging
with subjects or objects, producing residue in the form of traces that
influence a plurality of relational networks. Jennifer Pybus opens up a
crucial problematic in the experience of affect and subject/object
relationships on web platforms, that is framed in the following
question: What processes of redistribution of subjectivity are at play
in our relational networking with the adaptable algorithms that permeate
web usage?

In stride with this problematic, the present article will introduce and
define the concept of ectosubjectivity, in order to open up a
theoretical discussion about how digital adaptable algorithms
redistribute human subjectivity towards homogenization. Through an
exploration of Karl Marx's concept of the automated machine and Félix
Guattari's notions of machinic assemblages and subjectivity production,
this article will extract a protosubjective conceptualization of human
individuality, questioning its redistribution through the machinic
elements of adaptable algorithms.

## Fluidity and exchange

Imagine a towel. I hold it in my hands. Let's assume this towel has just
come out of the factory where it was produced. What constitutes it as a
towel is a multitude of properties and potentialities: its fibers are
aligned in a specific way, its texture is particular, it can dry my
hands, or the floor, or be curled in a useless or useful ball. Now if I
submerge the towel completely in water, it has changed. Yes, it has
become wet, but that is not all. The alignment of the fibers, the
texture of the towel, these properties have changed as well. In
addition, now that it is wet the potentialities of drying my hands or
the floor are reduced, while other, unforeseen potentialities have
emerged. Symmetrically, the water has also been transformed. Some of it might have left the bowl with
the towel, lowering its level. The water itself might contain new
molecules, bits of fibers: its molecular integrity has changed. Its potential as drinking water has been redistributed towards new relational territories.

In summary, both the towel and the water have been altered through their
contact. What was produced was an exchange and a
transformation.

From this simple example emerges the idea of an intricate process of
subjective networking. Just like the towel and the water, the networking
of human subjectivity with external processes (such as stimuli and
knowledge composites) has a transformative effect on the former and the
latter to varying degrees. Each and every single mediation, contact,
feeding, excretion, smile, sound, intensity is a mutation of human
subjectivities as humans and as agglomerations of atoms. I am not the
same this very minute that I was the previous, or that I will be in the
next. Both physically and psychologically, both individually and
collectively. There is constant exchange and residue, tension and
loosing, extraction and implantation.

This notion of fluidity was foreshadowed by Heraclitus more than two
thousand years ago, in his famous twelfth fragment: one cannot cross the
same river twice. The old maxim pertains to both the fluidity of all
processes and the mutability of identity. It is understood that the
river flows, but so do subjectivities engaged in the constant,
processual becomings of human life. The river is changed by the flow of
water; the human will grow older and evolve. But a transformation is
also produced by the very contact of human and river. The footprints of
the humans crossing the river might carry residue deposits, erode
stones, move the river bed, contaminate a downriver fish shoal, destroy
a bubble nest. Symmetrically, humans are transformed by the river: a
change in internal body temperatures, the memory of a river from
childhood, the sound of the flowing river producing a thought or muting
a warning cry, a wound from an unseen crab or twig. Just like the towel
and the water bowl, the relational network of subject-object is one of
exchange and transformation.

How do these examples relate to the adaptive algorithms of web
platforms, such as targeted advertisement, for example? The next section
will argue that the machinic alteration of human subjectivity crawls to
the subterranean levels of protosubjective elements, leading on to the
definition of ectosubjectivity.

## Machinic assemblages and fragmented subjectivities

Before introducing the concept of ectosubjectivity as protosubjective
fragments of human subjectivity that are extracted and transformed, the
machinic theorizations of two philosophers reveal tremendous importance
in understanding the transformative relationships of humans with
machines, or in other words, of subjects with objects.

To begin with, Marx's conception of the machine thinks machine
and human on the same ontological plane, breaking away from
traditional subject/object binarism. In his unfinished work
_Grundrisse_, Karl Marx wrote an influential fragment often called the
_Fragment on machines_. Marx's notion of the machine emerges from the
arrival of automation in factories. Automation redistributed the role of
the worker because machinic work mutated from a worker using a tool or
activating a machine towards the machine doing part of the work
automatically. Marx wrote: 

> The worker's activity, reduced to a mere
abstraction of activity, is determined and regulated on all sides by the
movement of the machinery, and not the opposite. The science which
compels the inanimate limbs of the machinery, by their construction, to
act purposefully, as an automaton, does not exist in the worker's
consciousness, but rather acts upon him through the machine as an alien
power, as the power of the machine itself. [-@marx_grundrisse_1993, 693]

Marx considers that the laborers' work is conditioned by machinic
processes that are integrated into their work, that a force of the
machine is imposed upon the workers' consciousness to codify how they
relate to the machine and how they work. This force is identified in the
ontological core of the machine, its design and construction, in which
science becomes apparent as an organizing force. The effect of this
machinic force on the workers is the redistribution of their
subjectivities as part of the machine: the worker becomes a cog in the
wheel. This is a massive redistribution of power that negates the
primacy of the human subjects over natural object or artifacts, proposing instead a relational perspective to the subject-object dyad. Here, human subjectivity and objects belong to the same smoothed ontological plane. What is more, humans are transformed at the contact of the machine's power. The worker is not a domineering subject acting on
a machinic object in a relation of production. He or she is subject and
object of the machine, created by the machine and creator of the
machine's work. In Marx's conception, it becomes apparent that the human
worker is already a machine in liminal networking with other machinic
assemblages. The workers' subjectivities are redefined towards new
territories of ontological distributions.

Similarly, Theodor Adorno, in his work on mass culture, theorized the mechanization of human consciousness in the capitalist context of art production. In his article _The Schema of Mass Culture_, Adorno wrote: "Imagination is replaced by a mechanically relentless control mechanism which determines whether the latest imago to be distributed really represents an exact, accurate and reliable reflection of the relevant item of reality." [-@adorno_schema_2005, 64] Human processes of imagination and cognition are here replaced with automatized mechanisms of assessment and value, what Adorno calls the "technicized forms of modern consciousness." [-@adorno_schema_2005, 96] Through the replacement of human affect by a value system integrated in the production of mass art itself, the human receiver is redistributed as a mere vessel of consumption. Thus, mass culture codifies human habits and consciousnesses towards fulfilling the needs and whims of the market, making them "objects that can be manipulated without further objection" [@adorno_schema_2005, 93]. As in Marx's conception from the _Grundrisse_, Adorno smoothes the borders between human subjects and machinic objects: human subjectivities seem somewhat subservient to the codification of their needs and habits through the massively distributed objects of mass culture. 

A second vision of the machine, namely Félix Guattari's essay _On Machines_, goes even further in redefining subject-object relations. In
this text, Guattari offers a conceptualization of the machine as engaged
in processual networking with a multiplicity of other machines: social
machines, economical machines, affective, artistic, organic, natural
machines. A multiplicity of connections happening at various speeds and
on various semiotic planes generates a productive chaos of liminal
networking. Guattari, like Marx, uproots the mechanical conception of
the machine in profit of a machinic regime where everything, even the
human, is a connective machine on a variety of ontological registers and
supports. That is to say that every networking produces new
semiotizations, every machine is embedded in machinic assemblages _ad
infinitum_. Guattari underlines the smoothing of the liminal borders
between machines and humans: "Ever since Leibnitz, the concept of an
articulated machine has been available, which one would qualify today as
fractal, with other machines which are themselves made up of infinite
machinic elements. Thus, the machine's environment forms part of
machinic agencements." [@guattari_machines_1995]

For Guattari, every machine has an ontological core, something he calls
protosubjectivity, that he closens to the _anima_ of humans and animals.
Protosubjective elements are inherently machinic, they are fragments of
the machine's ontological core, less than a whole, both connectable and
fractal. The machine has ontological affirmations of its own,
differentiated from its automatic processes, something with which other
protosubjective fragments can network. Thus, machines possess something
akin to human subjectivity, something that interacts with said
subjectivities to produce signification and new subjects in
relational networking. Through fluidity and exchange, all machines in a
specific assemblage are constantly becoming. In that regard, Maurizzio
Lazzarato, in his book _Signs and Machines_, offers a great example of
how protosubjectivities and human subjectivies connect to produce new
subjects. Lazzarato gives the example of driving a car to illustrate
machinic redistributions of subjectivity. The human driver surrenders a
portion of his or her consciousness to network with that of the car,
thus becoming part of the machinic assemblage of this particular car and
its movement. Lazzarato argues that the human driver is "guided by the
machinic assemblage" [-@lazzarato_signs_2014, 89], meaning that the driver becomes one more
machinic element in the assemblage, on the same ontological level as the
engine, the brakes, the ignition, the wheels, etc. This example speaks
directly to Marx's notion of the machine acting upon human consciousness
in the driver's resubjectivation on the same plane as engineering and
machinic movement. Without the driver there is no movement; without the
car there is no mechanical movement[^1]. To summarize, Guattari's
concept of protosubjectivity reframes all machines as possessing cores
of ontological affirmation, as well as the potentialities of connection
between elements of machinic assemblages with fragments of human
subjectivity.

Guattari's notion of protosubjectivity hints at the concept of
ectosubjectivity because it identifies the fragmentation of an
assemblage (a machine) into smaller ontological elements
(protosubjectivities). Similarly, I want to argue that an assemblage
(human subjectivity) can be fragmented into smaller parts
(ectosubjectivities) which are connectable and transformable. If the
machine and the human are redistributed on the same ontological plane,
following Pierre Lévy's desire to bring down the iron curtain between
things and humans [@levy_les_1990], it should follow that some ontological
similarities emerge from a stripping down of their phenomenological
appearance as 'machine' and 'human'. Following the idea that humans and
objects belong to the same ontological plane, if a machine is an
agglomeration of fractal elements, why should a human subjectivity be a
complete whole, undividable and immovable? Again, if a machine, as Marx
argued, can act upon human subjectivity and, as Lazzaratto argued, if
machinic assemblages redistribute human subjectivity by guiding it, how
can it follow that a subjectivity is undividable and immovable? My
conclusion follows my argumentation: human subjectivities are dividable
and movable, mutable and fractal. They are constituted of ectosubjective
fragments which contemporary machines, algorithms and artificial
intelligence, extract and transform into power through an imperfect hermeneutics of fragmentality. The next section will define the concept of ectosubjectivity and subsequently analyze how
contemporary, adaptable machines manipulate these fragments.

## Defining Ectosubjectivities

Ectosubjectivities are ontologically mutable subjective fragments:
desires, postures, ideas and opinions as they emerge and fade, rituals,
actions or patterns, agglomerations of pictures and statuses on social
media, acts of resistance or submission, among an endless supply of
examples. They are transformative and transformable, they rise up in the
present in certain forms that always become other in the next
emergences. They are what the towel was produced from: undifferentiated
materials that coalesced to emerge as 'towel' before disappearing towards a new becoming. They are the water molecules, rocks, fishes and
amphibians, bacteria and residue that formed the flowing river,
continually transforming anew by movement, exchange and molecular
fluidity.

Ectosubjectivities are protosubjective, meaning they are something less
than a whole subjectivity, a fragment that is networked with a
multiplicity of other fragments, in the fashion of a Guattarian machine
[-@guattari_machines_1995] or a Deleuzian molecular network [@boutang_abecedaire_1996]. The word fragment here
relates to oscillations [@buchanan_deleuze_2008, 10] and intensities, not
structure. Their coalescing does not produce a coherent whole, but
rather oscillations to a variety of ontological wavelengths and
resonations with external pressures at given times and spaces to produce
subjective revealing. To frame the concept of ectosubjectivity in
guattarian terms, it is one of the plural _facteurs ontologiques_
alongside fluxes, machinic phylums, existential territories and
incorporeal universes, all figures of conjunctions of intensities
[@guattari_quest-ce_2018, 300].

Jennifer Pybus, in her previously cited article, borrowed Deleuze's
definition of subjectivity as the tension between an inside and an
outside [@deleuze_pourparlers_1990, 238], and juxtaposed to it the notion of
vitality affect as an accumulative, productive force of communality.
What that offered was a definition of affect that considered both
internal arrangements and external pressures, as well as something that
is shared by accumulation in subject/subject or subject/object
relationships. It can be theorized, following Pybus, that the
configuration of ectosubjective fragments in a specific space-time, in
tension with the external pressures of machinic networks, is what
produces human individual subjectivity as it is imperfectly, temporarily
revealed as a "C'était donc ça !"[@deleuze_anti-oedipe_1972] The "C'était
donc ça !", I must note, understands the evanescence of the unconcealment
in its use of the past tense. Human subjectivity is not static but
dynamic, fluid and constantly redefined and challenged anew by the
reterritorializations of internal and external networking.

Thus, ectosubjectivities are fragments of an ever-flowing whole,
discontinuous in space and in time, in constant mutation. As such,
ectosubjectivities are always subjected both to a redistribution of
their configurations as well as the pressures of external processes. 

One of these semiotizing processes is the extraction, interpretation and
reintegration of web data from and into human subjectivities. Adaptable
algorithms of deep-learning, such as AdSense or Facebook Ads, target
some ectosubjective fragments (demography, online preferences, location
services, consumption habits, social media trends) in order to push
relevant content to users. That process of data mining interprets and
acts upon fragments of human subjectivity by considering them as
complete and unchanging wholes rather than evolving multiplicities.
Hence, knowledge is produced by the interpretation of fragments; power
is exercised _a posteriori_ on imperfect and past representations of
individualities and collectivities.

Some concrete examples might further illustrate the problem at hand.

A Facebook profile can be considered as the exact reflection of an
individual's life by an employer looking to screen potential candidates.
The interpretation by the employer of the potential employee's quote
from _Mein Kampf_ or _Cannibal Holocaust_, or pictures holding alcoholic
beverages on his Facebook wall is acted upon as problematic and the
candidacy may be rejected.

A one-time online purchase can be considered as a consumption habit and
be advertised continuously to the buyer to enhance and further this
habit. Products faintly related to the purchase can even be pushed to
the user, for example services of bicycle repairs for someone who bought
a bicycle brand water bottle. It does not matter if the purchase was a
gift, a mistake, a singular event; the products will be pushed to the buyer
for an extended period of time and on a variety of connected platforms.

The interpretation of internet usage data as a voting intention or a
political position, as witnessed in the Cambridge Analytics scandal, is
acted upon through propaganda and attempts at furthering the candidacy
of one candidate over the other. It does not matter if a _Like_ was made
by error, or if opinions have changed, or if the web usage was done by a
guest on the main user's platform. The extraction of data will be acted
upon via a saturation of content implanted into the excavated
subjectivities to try and foster political support for a particular
party or candidate.

These examples showcase the problematic frailty of adaptive algorithms
in their attempts at creating a fixed model for subjectivity from one or
several of its ectosubjective fragments. The algorithms have the
tendency to negate the singularity of ectosubjectivities: fragments are
considered as totalities [@guattari_quest-ce_2018, 280]. The redistribution of
knowledge in the excavated subjectivities takes the form of mediation:
content, adverts, propaganda, social media personae, etc. These
mediations cannot but be imperfect, non-adapted and homogenized, because
they consider subjectivities as static and are ruled by monetary
hierarchical choices of what content will be distributed by the
platforms. Thus, the algorithms think the users [@vitali-rosati_pour_2018],
think they think the user correctly and, accordingly, try to act upon a
representation of the user generated from the interpretation of
ectosubjective fragments. What is problematic in that regard is that
when the mediations are implanted back into the initial subjectivity, it
has already moved on to new becomings[^2]. Whereas the information distributed is static in its interpretation of ectosubjectivities, human subjectivity is in constant movement
towards new territories of being.

However, whenever a human is engaged in processual networking with an
outside (machines, processes, other humans, desires, events), some
ectosubjectivities will be redistributed, deleted, added and mutated
within that subjectivity, may it be one organism or a collective[^3].
And although it comes *after* the moment of individuation which gave way
to the excavation, the process of extraction and implantation has the
effect of transforming the targeted subjectivity by codifying its future
rising into the present.

## Subjectivity production and serialization

Indeed, the temporal adaptability of algorithms is constantly evolving.
Accordingly, the delay between the extraction and reintegration of
ectosubjectivities is reduced to the point of quasi-instantaneity.
However, as I have previously argued, they still lack the immediacy of
individuation. They always _react_ to a certain configuration of
subjectivity, unless they are integrated into the processes of
subjectivation that _precede_ individuation, something they are unable
to do adequately as of yet. Accordingly, algorithms are increasingly
trying to define and fixate fractal identities so as to reduce their
delay in answering accelerating changes in consumption, habits,
opinions, trends [@levy_world_2000, 67]. Algorithms thus constitute a
collective equipment of subjectivity production which, by producing
knowledge about its human users, also attempts to codify their future
affects, their relationships with other subjects and objects, their
habits and universes of reference.

I have argued that the unconcealment of subjectivity is the product of
the permeable tension between an inside and an outside, and that
algorithmic implantation of transformed ectosubjectivities consists in
an outside permeating the inside of human subjectivity to try and fixate it in a
certain posture. What, then are the effects of this external pressure of
algorithmic implantation of transformed ectosubjectivities into
excavated subjectivities? In other words, what forces of production are
imposed upon human subjectivities by adaptive algorithms?

Although the aim of this article is merely to define ectosubjectivities,
I cannot but attempt to frame this question towards future study. One
answer lies within Guattari's conceptualization of
subjectivity-production.

Speaking about machines and subjectivity, Guattari argued that "[t]he
relation between the inside and the outside of a machinic system is not
only the result of a consummation of energy, of the production of an
object: it is equally manifested through genetic phylums. A machine
rises to the surface of the present like the completion of a past
lineage, and it is the point of restarting, or of rupture, from which an
evolutionary lineage will spread in the future." [-@guattari_guattari_1996, 267] Guattari
theorizes individuation as a phylogenetic event, a mere spark along the
gargantuan conflagrations of machinic networking, informed by its
lineage and informing its successors. As such, machinic processes such
as adaptive algorithms can apply an external pressure on certain
configurations, or machinic 'rises into the surface of the present' in order to overwrite the coding of the rising
machine to inform its phylogenetic successors. For example, by
constantly distributing content about a political ideology to users
answering to specific criteria, by implanting ideology through continual
external pressure, there is a potential for transformation of the
becoming of certain subjectivities, either through resistance,
indifference, mimesis or any other posture. In any case, the saturation
of mediations that defines our societies will influence future rises
into the present of the chosen subjectivities.

I have theorized that ectosubjectivities are extracted as data by the
adaptive algorithms of targeted content and manipulated in the attempt
to codify habits, relational networks, territories of semiotic grasping,
etc. Taking into consideration that these altered fragments are then
distributed back into the excavated subjectivities as discourse _about_
said subjectivities via mediation, it becomes quite clear that the
conversion of knowledge into power has a transformative potential. The
conversion of desire into interest, a key to _Anti-Oedipus_ according to
Ian Buchanan [-@buchanan_deleuze_2008, 11] is unconcealed both by the external pressures of
adaptable, consumable content and the capitalistic hierarchy of content visibility for users.

What is the effect on users of this external pressure that has the
potential of rearranging the internal disposition of humans, and even maybe the thin
membrane of permeation? In other words, if human subjectivities are in
part produced by external processes such as algorithms, what, then,
becomes apparent when they are fragmented in a multiplicity of
ectosubjective elements? In the _Grundrisse_, Marx argued that it was
science that became apparent in the organization of the machine,
exercising power upon the worker's consciousness. Considering the
connectability of machinic protosubjectivities and human
ectosubjectivities, I want to argue that the organizing productive force
made apparent in the ontological core of ectosubjectivities is
_serialization_.

My hypothesis that serialization is the organizing force made apparent
in the the extraction and reinsertion of ectosubjective fragments echoes
with Guattari's ideas about capitalistic production of subjectivity. In
an interview with Jacques Pain, he argued that the production of
capitalistic subjectivity in the nineties differed from either
pre-capitalist or proto-capitalist societies because it was based on
artificial production and a "paradoxical cocktail of _hyper-segregation_
and _generalized communication_." [-@guattari_guattari_1996, 124] He added: "It is
necessary to see that individuated subjectivity has become the object of
a sort of industrial production." [-@guattari_guattari_1996, 129]
Guattari considered the collective equipments of power as producing
homogeneity, in direct relation to Adorno's claim that the "schema of mass culture now prevails as a canon of synthetically produced modes of behavior." [-@adorno_schema_2005, 91]
Through the ubiquity of mediation in the twenty-first century, individualities are increasingly reterritorialized towards regimes of serialized production. Notions of artificial and industrial subjectivity production cannot but remind
directly of a factory production line where perfectly identical and
inanimate objects flow on a conveyor belt[^4], or of Magritte's painting _Golconde_ where seemingly identical men are stuck in limbo on the grid of serialization.

Serialization is made apparent in the extraction of swarming personal
data and its redistribution as knowledge in the harvested human
subjectivities [^5]. This implanted knowledge often concerns the subject,
what is best for the subject, how he or she should act, consume, think,
etc. Just like mineral mining, mining for data creates holes and
fractures in subjectivities, ectosubjective absence, which are then
filled with serialized narratives or messages. For example: 'This
product will make you a better person, husband, father,' 'This product
or new habit will change your existence,' or again 'Voting for this
political candidate is the right idea for you and your
country/province/region.' In advertisements, for example, an idealized
lifestyle (idealized in the sense that it fits the representational mold
of 'ideal') is represented, which often does not even concern the
product or service advertised[^6].

Serialization is but one of the organizing forces made apparent in the
fracturing of subjectivity. Just as the underlying organizing force of
science was made apparent in the networking of the machine with the
worker, a similar process of revealing is at play when human
subjectivity is stripped down to its ectosubjective elements and altered
by relational contact with serialized narratives and mediations. In that
state of fragmentation, subjectivities are interpreted and acted upon by
fractal algorithms, discourses and semiotizations. Hence, they are
altered: knowledge is produced about them and reintegrated into them
through mediation and content consumption. The data produced _about_ the
fragmented subjectivities becomes power-knowledge once analyzed,
transformed and reinserted because it is built to govern human bodies
and minds by way of serialization.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, adaptive algorithms displayed by AdSense and the Facebook
interface is one of the many processes of redistribution of humans
leading to subjective homogeneity. Although I have discussed the subject
in the previous section, the following question leads to further study:

> How is serialization, revealed through the fragmentation of human subjectivities, reproduced and resisted by subjects through the redistribution of ectosubjective elements?

If serialization acts upon the subjects as an organizing force,
transforming them into new subjects, or rather forcing their becoming to
fit a certain mold in their subsequent individuations, islands of
resistance cannot but counterweigh the continents of acquiescence. A
worker who has a bad performance review is redistributed as a problem
for the company, regardless of personal issues such as mental health or
illness. His boss and coworkers, through their attitude of disdain or
helpfulness, strengthen this redefinition of the individual through a
single aspect of his or her life. Similarly, when 87 million[^7]
unknowing Facebook users whose data is analyzed and acted upon to
influence their voting intentions go out and actually vote, are they
aware that a fragment of their subjectivity has been extracted,
analyzed, and reinserted to influence this specific action. How are
these mimetic acquiescences of serialization reproduced and resisted?
Are the postures of resistance or reproduction already codified and, if
so, how? How many of our habits, thoughts and practices are thus
artificially implanted through the constant saturation of mediation we
are subjected to? 

It appears evident that one question leads to a whole web of new
problems concerning individuality, agency, individuation and
subjectivity production at the age of mass-mediation.

As a final point, the extraction and implantation of ectosubjective
elements by processes such as adaptive algorithms speak to, while
redefining the networks of, power-knowledge. Power is exercised through
a continual networking with digital processes of semiotization, through
not only an extraction but more importantly through an implantation, a
serialized graft. Are these processes modulations of the societies of
control introduced by Deleuze, or has the accelerations of the
